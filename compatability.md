# Compatability Chart
If your device is not supported, please do not open an issue. Obviously I would want my ROMs to work on all devices, but this takes time.

# Getting support for your device
If you want to test potential builds for your device, contact me, as I can't feasibly own 20+ devices and test them all.

**DISCLAIMER: my builds come with no warranty. Any damage to your devices is your responsibility, as you decide to flash them knowing they may be harmful.**
My ROMs have not damaged any devices that I know of, but you know how it is.
