# Reporting a bug/issue
If you encounter a bug, glitch or issue with the ROM, submit a bug report! It ensures that things have a chance of getting fixed.

However, I do have a few guidelines:
- Follow the issue templates, they are there for a reason!
- Don't duplicate bug reports
- Be descriptive and constructive
- Provide bug report zips, logcats, last_kmsg, dmesg logs. Whichever is relevant
- English only
- Don't ask for ETAs in bug reports, it isn't helpful
- Don't report a bug if it is a lineage specific issue (ie you dont like the default launcher)

If you don't follow these guidelines, I will close the issue report. 

# Unsupported configs
I provide support to my ROMs based on how they come out of the box. If you;
- Install root
- Xposed or similar mods
- Custom Kernels
- Install on an unsupported device

I will not provide support. It would be too time consuming for me to do so. Hope you understand.
