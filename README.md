# Installation instructions
1) Boot to your custom recovery (I am using TWRP)
2) Wipe Dalvik, Caches, Data, System
3) Flash/sideload release
4) Flash gapps/magisk if necessary
5) Reboot (DO NOT INSTALL TWRP APP OR YOU WONT BE ABLE TO BOOT)

# Gapps
There are several options for gapps. We want ARM64 and Android 12.1

- For OpenGapps, there is an "unofficial" google drive with updated 12.1 installers.
- BitGapps works fine
- MindTheGapps can be made to work by modifying the installer zip file. You can get a pre-modified one in this releases section also.

# Reporting a bug/issue
If you encounter a bug, glitch or issue with the ROM, submit a bug report! It ensures that things have a chance of getting fixed.
However, I do have a few guidelines:
- Don't duplicate bug reports
- Be descriptive and constructive
- Provide bug report zips, logcats, last_kmsg, dmesg logs. Whichever is relevant
- English only
- Don't ask for ETAs
- Don't report a bug if it is a lineage issue (ie you dont like the default launcher)

If you don't follow these guidelines, I will close the issue report.

# Unsupported configs
I provide support to my ROMs based on how they come out of the box. If you;
- Install root
- Xposed or similar mods
- Custom Kernels
- Install on an unsupported device (see compatability.md for supported devices)
I will not provide support. It would be too time consuming for me to do so. Hope you understand.
